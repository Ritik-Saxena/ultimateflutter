## Implementation Details

The Workout App UI is built using the Flutter framework and employs the Bloc state management approach for managing bottom navigation. The app features a custom navigation bar with dynamic dot indicators that visually guide users through the various sections of the app.
<br>
### State Management

- Bottom navigation is implemented using Bloc. The bottom navigation bar dynamically changes the selected item and updates the UI based on user interaction.
<br>
### Widgets and UI

- The app features a home screen with a custom AppBar and workout data cards.

- The bottom navigation bar provides quick access to different sections of the app, enhancing user navigation.

- Tabs are used to categorize exercises, making it easy for users to find their desired workout routines.
